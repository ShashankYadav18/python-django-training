# what is loop

# loop is basically a way to repeat a block of code multiple time untill certain condition is match

#while and for loop

# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]


# list1 = [1,55,333,88,23,56,6]

#gen syntax of for loop

#for i in list1:
#    print(i * 2)
    
    
#for i in range(1,10,5):
 #   print(i)
    
    
#for i in range(1,3):
  #  print("table of",i)
 #   for j in range(1,2,3,4):
  #      print(i,"X", j, "=",i*)
        
#fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry","kiwi"]

#for i in fruits:
  #  if(i=="banana"):
  #      print(i)
        
#write a function sum number(n) that use for loop to calculate sum of all number
#write a function sum number(n) that use for loop to calculate sum of even number
